<h2>Virtual Machine Crash in Rendering Code</h2>
<p>
  JDK 1.6.0 (initial version) sometimes crashes when rendering huge glyphs. This
  will happen if you zoom into the view and use extreme zoom levels (far greater than 10).
  Updating the JDK will fix this (note that there is no issue and no entry in the change log
  of the JDK for this).
</p>
<p>
  Occasionally, we have experienced crashes of the Virtual Machine and HotSpot errors 
  when using antialiased painting and at the same time having the smoothed bends 
  feature of PolyLineEdgeRealizer enabled. 
  This is a JDK bug (Bug ID: 5089985) and is fixed in newer versions of the JDK. 
</p>
<p>
  Occasionally, we have experienced crashes of the Virtual Machine and HotSpot errors
  when using ShadowNodePainter with Suns Java 1.4.2. JDK 1.5 and higher seem to work stable with ShadowNodePainter.
</p>

<h2>Repaint Bugs in Graph2DView</h2>

<p>
We have experienced occasional repaint bugs in Graph2DView when Suns Java-1.4.0
is being used as Java Runtime. This problem has been reported on Linux and Windows
Operation Systems. 
</p><p>
Sometimes the problem can be solved by upgrading the graphics card
device driver, sometimes not. This problem has not been reported to occur when Java-1.3.x
or Java 1.4.1 is being used as Java Runtime, therefore we suggest not to use Java 1.4.0.
</p>


<h2>Lost Focus Bugs on Windows OS</h2>

<p>
We have experienced problems with losing the keyboard focus when Suns Java-1.4.0
is being used on Windows operating systems. The problem does not occur 
when Java-1.3.x or Java 1.4.1 is being used as Java Runtime.
</p>
<p>In order to avoid that problem we suggest not to use Java 1.4.0. 
</p>

<h2>Incorrect JToolbar Display in Windows L&amp;F</h2>

<p>
Incorrect display of toolbar separators are a known problem of older versions of the Java Runtime
(Bug-ID: 4722908). This problem is not present in newer versions of the JRE.
</p>

<h2>Exception in AWT Thread Relating to Empty JTree</h2>
<p>
When Java 1.4.0 is used and the following conditions are met using yEd:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the JTree on the left has no items, but focus 
</li>
<li>
a key is pressed 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
then an exception will be thrown in the AWT thread. 
This is a JDK bug and the problem does not occur when using other versions of the JRE.
